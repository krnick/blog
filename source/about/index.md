### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Who am I

JunWei is a security researcher from Taiwan with a passion for malware analysis and building tools to detect malware and threats in innovative ways, and working on sandboxing for Android platforms right now. Also, I enjoy contributing to the open-source security community, having made a tool accepted by Kali Linux, and leading the GSoC mentorship program under the Honeynet project in 2021.

Experienced in Python programming and Android malware forensics and detection. I am also the creator of the well-known open-source project, [Quark-Engine](https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-engine), an Android malware scoring tool that can help malware analysts speed up the malware analysis process and get an overview of the malicious behavior inside malware within a few seconds.

Also, as a volunteer for the PyCon TW program chair, I helped organize the PyCon conference. I also gave talks at top-tier security conferences like Black Hat, DEFCON, HITB, and ROOTCON.
