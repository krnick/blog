### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Who am I

JunWei is a malware researcher at Recorded Future Triage Sandbox. With a passion for malware analysis, reverse engineering, and threat intelligence. Also, Iâ€™ve been very involved in open-source projects, used to be the lead developer of Quark-Engine, mentor of the GSoC Honeynet project, and package maintainer of Kali Linux.
