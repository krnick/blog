### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Who am I

JunWei is a security researcher from Taiwan, mainly focusing on malware analysis, and is also an enthusiast who is highly involved in the open-source security community.

Experienced in Python programming and Android malware forensics and detection. I am also the co-founder of the well-known open-source project, Quark-Engine, an Android malware scoring tool that can help malware analysts speed up the malware analysis process and get an overview of the malicious behavior inside malware within a minute.

Also, as a volunteer for the PyCon TW program chair, I helped organize the PyCon conference. I also gave talks at security conferences like Black Hat, DEFCON, HITB, ROOTCON.
