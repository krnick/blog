#### Who am I

JunWei is a security researcher from Taiwan with a passion for malware analysis and threat intelligence, currently focusing on malware sandboxing.

Experience with Python and Android malware analysis. I am also the creator of an open source project [Quark-Engine](https://github.com/quark-engine/quark-engine), integrated by many great open-source projects such as Kali Linux, BlackArch, etc., and it then become a GSoC program under the Honeynet project since 2021.
